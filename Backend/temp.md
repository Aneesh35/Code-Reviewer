**Issues:**
- `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
- The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible.
- The arrow function syntax is missing the variable declaration.

**Suggestions:**
- Define the variables `a` and `b` within the function scope or pass them as arguments.
- Consider using parameters to make the function more versatile.
- Add variable declaration to arrow function.

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

**Bad Code :**
```javascript
sum = () => {
  return x + y;
};
```

The bad code is poorly written because `x` and `y` are not defined within the function or passed as arguments, and because the const keyword is missing. This will likely lead to errors and makes the code difficult to understand and maintain.

**Summary:**
The original code snippet has issues with variable scope, lack of arguments, and syntax errors. The suggestions address these problems by defining variables, using parameters, and providing a corrected arrow function syntax.
